\chapter{General Idea}
The dependently typed language Agda is lacking a decent compiler at the time of writing. While there
exist three backends for Agda, of which one is maintained, all three have their shortcomings.
The aim of this proposal is to create a new backend for Agda, using the UHC Core language
as intermediate language to produce efficient executables. Apart from just being able to compile
Agda code, it shall also be researched how a FFI interface between Agda and Haskell can be constructed,
what restrictions apply to such a FFI binding and how it may interfere with optimizations.

\chapter{Existing Backends}
The current version of Agda has three backends. The MAlonzo backend targets Haskell as intermediate
language, which is then compiled using GHC. The JS backend, as it's name says, targets javascript
and is intended for compiling web applications. Lastly, the Epic backend targets the Epic language
and uses the Epic compiler to produce an executable.
We shall now look at these three backends a bit more in depth.


\section{MAlonzo}
MAlonzo is the only officially maintained backend of Agda and is able to compile the whole standard
library. The original implementation is described in \cite{benke2007alonzo}, but has undergone
heavy changes in the meantime.
This backend contains no optimizations, apart from special handling of some Agda builtin
datatypes like Nat. Instead, the MAlonzo compiler relies on GHC for optimizations, which depending
on the Agda program works to differing degress. Especially in situations where the type information
present in Agda would be required to perform optimizations, the limitations of the current implementation
become apparent.
% Nat is an example

While this problems can be overcome, it also needs to be mentioned that the target language Haskell
is not a perfect fit for compiling Agda. As Haskell doesn't support dependent types, the produced
code contains a lot of "coerce" statements to cheat the haskell type system. Notwithstanding any
bugs in the Agda backend, this should be safe but shows that there is a mismatch between the
two languages.

While the generated Haskell
code can theoretically be called from normal Haskell programs, this is not intended nor supported
by MAlonzo except via explicit FFI declarations. For the MAlonzo FFI similar problems as with
the approach outlined in the UHC Core proposal in chapter \ref{chp:proposal} have to be expected.
As GHC features a more expressive type system than UHC,
it might be possible to extend the MAlonzo FFI to a greater subset of Agda, but a complete mapping
between Agda and Haskell still seems unattainable.

The implementation of MAlonzo is of reasonable coding quality, but the code is deeply entangled with the Haskell
pretty printing. This makes it hard to reuse this backend for other target languages, altough it can
certainly provide inspiration on how to solve certain problems.

\section{Epic}
The Epic backend \cite{fredriksson2011totaly} of Agda uses the Epic language \cite{Brady:2011:ELG:2362963.2362968} as intermediate
language, relying on the Epic compiler to produce an executable. This backend incorporates some optimizations, but is no longer
maintained. The same also applies to the Epic compiler itself, which is unmaintained too.

The backend is well-structured and the code is of reasonable quality. It features an FFI to the Epic language,
which is used to define some basic primitives. It is not possible to interact with Haskell code easily,
as Epic is compiled to C.

The backend features the most extensive optimizations out of all three backends. This backend is currently not able
to compile the whole Agda standard library, but small standalone programs can be made work with some effort. It
uses an internal AST representation of Epic, which decouples the backend from the pretty printing of Epic.
This enables the reuse of large parts of this backend for similar target languages, by simply adapting the pretty printing
part.


\section{Javascript}
The Javascript backend \cite{Jeffrey:2013:agda-js} of Agda targets the Javascript language. This backend
is no longer maintained and cannot compile the standard library.

The translation of Agda to Javascript in itself poses no major problems, as Javascript is untyped. The
only major missing feature is pattern matching, which is translated into the visitor pattern.
As this backend attempts to make interoperability
with other Javascript code straight-forward, the compiled code follows certain Javascript-Idioms.

Worth noting is that Javascript does not guarantee that tail-calls are optimized, which could impact
the efficiency of the generated code.

The backend features well organized code with a good level of source code comments. The implementation
is clearly tailored towards the Javascript language, and would thus require major modifications to change the
target language.


\section{Comparison}
A more detailed comparison of the three existing backends can be seen in table \ref{tbl:backends-comp}.

From an user perspective, MAlonzo is the only viable choice right now. All other backends
are not maintained, and documentation is scarce or outdated.

The Epic backend, on the other hand, is more promising as the basis or inspiration for new backends.
It offers a large array of optimizations and is well structured.

Lastly, the Javascript backend can offer some insights into how to
compile to Javascript or similar languages. As this quite differs from
the goal of producing an efficient executable, this backend does not offer much
additional inspiration when targeting Haskell, Epic or UHC Core.

\chapter{Prototype Compiler}
A prototype backend for Agda has been created, and it has been shown that it is feasible to compile
Agda using UHC Core. As the name suggests, this is just a prototype and not suitable for any serious use.

The prototype is based on the Epic backend of Agda. Because the Epic and UHC Core Languages are
very similar, this proved to be a reasonable approach. For a short overview of the two target
languages, see figure \ref{tbl:pro-langs}.

\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}

\end{tabular}
\caption{The abstract syntax of Epic and UHC Core. Irrelevant parts of the syntax have been omitted for brevity. The
$\vec{t}$ notation is used to denote a list of things.}
\label{tbl:pro-langs}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

One major difference is that Epic is strict, whereas UHC Core is lazy. As Agda does not specify
any evaluation order, this difference can be mostly ignored. There are also some other
minor variations, but the two languages remain very similar overall.

\paragraph{Supported Features}
The prototype supports all basic Agda constructs such as dependent functions and data types.
However, support for Coinduction is missing, and a lot of other more advanced features like instance arguments
have not been tested.

As only the compilation of exactly one (top-level) module is supported, the prototype could not
be tested using existing code like the Agda Standard library. It is also likely that issues
present in the Epic Backend carry over to the UHC Backend as well. For example, the Epic
Backend is not able to compile the whole Agda Standard library.

It is possible to link the Agda module with one or more Haskell modules. Agda postulates
and datatypes can be mapped to Haskell datatypes, altough the mapping has to be specified
by the user on the UHC Core level with pragmas. An example can be seen in listing \ref{lst:agda-hs-pragmas}.


\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
data List (A : Set) : Set where
  [] : List A
  _::_ : (x : A) (xs : List A) -> List A
{-# COMPILED_CORE_DATA List Data.List ([],0) (:,1) #-}

postulate
    IO      : Set -> Set
    return  : {A : Set} -> A -> IO A
    _>>=_   : {A B : Set} -> IO A -> (A -> IO B) -> IO B
    putStrLn : String -> IO Unit


{-# COMPILED_CORE return (\a x -> UHC.Agda.Builtins.primReturn x) #-}
{-# COMPILED_CORE _>>=_ (\a b x y -> UHC.Agda.Builtins.primBind x y) #-}
{-# COMPILED_CORE putStrLn (UHC.Agda.Builtins.primPutStrLn) #-}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Agda pragmas to map Agda functions to Core functions.}
\label{lst:agda-hs-pragmas}
\end{figure}

No optimizations from the Epic backend have been ported to the UHC backend. While this
would have been straightforward for some of the optimizations, it would have made the
interfacing with Haskell more complicated.

A small set of builtin functions have been defined, which are implemented in Haskell
and installed into the UHC package database by the UHC Agda backend automatically. These
builtins export the Haskell IO Monad to UHC Core in a format suitable for Agda.
The builtins can then be bound to Agda identifiers using the \texttt{COMPILED_CORE} pragmas
already seen in listing \ref{lst:agda-hs-pragmas}.


\paragraph{Implementation}
The Agda UHC backend generates an UHC Core AST, using functions and datatypes exported
by the UHC library EH99. The constructed AST is then serialized in textual or binary format
to the disk. The serialized file is then compiled by calling UHC with the correct parameters.

The implementation can be found mostly in the folder "src/full/Agda/Compiler/UHC" inside
the Agda repository. The module
names match those inside the Epic backend ("src/full/Agda/Compiler/Epic"), where possible.

The module \texttt{Agda.Compiler.UHC.Compiler} is the main entry point for the UHC Backend.
It controls the whole compilation run and calls UHC at appropriate times to compile the
generated Core files to executables.

The \texttt{Agda.Compiler.UHC.AuxAST} module contains the intermediate AST used inside the UHC Backend,
which is translated into UHC Core in the module \texttt{Agda.Compiler.UHC.Core}.

The module \texttt{Agda.Compiler.UHC.FromAgda} contains the translation from the internal Agda AST
to the intermediate AST from \texttt{Agda.Compiler.UHC.AuxAST}.

The module \texttt{Agda.Compiler.UHC.CoreSyntax} contains some helper functions used by
the Agda parser to parse Agda \texttt{COMPILED_CORE} Pragmas.

The module \texttt{Agda.Compiler.UHC.Primitives} contains the builtin and primitive functions
supported by the UHC Backend. Agda definitions marked as builtin/primitive are translated
to the respective built in implementation when compiling.


The support library for Agda programs containing builtin definitions like \texttt{Nat} can
be found in the directory "src/data/uhc-agda-base".

\chapter{Proposal}
\label{chp:proposal}



\section{Compiling Agda to UHC Core}
The basic algorithm to compile Agda to UHC Core has already been explored in the prototype. More
advanced Agda features are not supported in the prototype, and I expect that completing the
Agda-Core translation will definitely require some work. Keeping this in mind,
I anticipate no major problems.

\section{Agda Module Support}
\subsection{Per-module Compilation}
The simplest approach to compiling Agda programs is to compile all Agda modules in one go
and perform all transformations and optimizations on the complete program. Nonetheless, from
a user perspective it would be preferrable to support per-module or per-package compilation,
as this could shorten compile times.

\subsection{Parameterised Agda Modules}
Parametrized Agda modules can be mapped to normal plain modules, where every function get's the
modules parameter as additional arguments.
\footnote{See \url{http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=ReferenceManual.Modules}}

See also \ref{sec:ffi:par-mod} for the implications this feature has on the FFI aspect.

\section{Haskell FFI}
\label{sec:prop:hs-ffi}
Writing all code in plain Agda might often be possible, but it might sometimes be more
convenient to use Haskell Code from Agda and vice versa. Having such a facility would
also allow reusing the many libraries available for Haskell, which would make using Agda
for usable applications much easier.

It would also be preferrable, if as much as possible type-safety gained by Agda could be
preserved when interacting with the Haskell world. Creating an unsafe Agda-Haskell
FFI, while being definitely easier, would risk introducing new bugs. Hence, an approach
where the type checker ensures the correctness of FFI calls is the main goal, wherever
this is possible.


\subsection{Names}
The naming policies in Haskell and Agda differ. Both allow the use of unicode symbols in names, but Haskell enforces
that constructor names always start with an upper case letter. It also requires constructor names to be unique
per module, whereas Agda allows using the same name for multiple constructors.

The simplest approach is to just restrict the FFI to entities only containing names valid in both worlds.
This could be extended using a more advanced encoding to solve some of the problems, for example
by converting the first letter of the generated HS constructors to upper case.

The best case would be to have a complete encoding, mapping all possible names across the language boundary. It is not known
if such an encoding exists, given the constraint that the generated names should be human-readable.

As an alternative, it might also be a good idea to allow the users to choose the exported name of the entities themselves.
This is especially true when exporting Agda entities, as Agda features a bigger namespace.

\subsection{Plain functions and datatypes}
For simply-typed functions and datatypes, the mapping between HS and Agda is straight-forward. An example of such
a translation can be seen in listing \ref{lst:plain-agda-hs}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
id : {A : Set} -> A -> A
id x = x

rnk2 : {A : Set} -> A
    -> ((B : Set) -> B -> A)
rnk2 = ...

data List (A : Set) : Set where
  nil : List A
  cons : A -> List A -> List A

-- Agda doesn't support records with
-- multiple constructors. Could be
-- mapped to a normal datatype.
data MultiRecord : Set where
  Rec1 : String -> Int -> MultiRecord
  Rec2 : String -> Bool -> MultiRecord
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\hspace{10pt}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
id :: forall a . a -> a
id x = x

rnk2 :: forall a . a
    -> (forall b . b -> a)
rnk2 = ..

data List a where
  Nil :: List a
  Cons :: a -> List a -> List a




data MultiRecord
  = Rec1 { f1 :: String, f2 :: Int }
  | Rec2 { f1 :: String, f3 :: Bool }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{The mapping between plain Agda and Haskell functions and datatypes.}
\label{lst:plain-agda-hs}
\end{figure}

The prototype discussed earlier only supports a subset of this mappings. The only discovered
issue was that in the Agda backend, types were not completely erased when translating to Core.
Although the types were translated, they are never evaluated. The UHC HS backend on the
other hand completely erases all type information. This difference shouldn't cause any major problems,
as it can easily be handled inside the FFI itself.


\subsection{Depdendently typed functions and datatypes}
As with most FFI's, there is a feature-gap between the two languages involved. While for plain datatypes a clear
translation between the two worlds exist, this is no longer the case when dependent types are used.

The usual approach to bridge this gap is to let the user define translation functions, which take
values from one world translating it into the other. For the Haskell FFI, this corresponds to marshalling
datatypes from C to HS and back. In Haskell, this translation is done on the HS side.

In contrast, \cite{Osera:2012:DI:2103776.2103779} treats the conversion functions as special entities
which live inbetween the two worlds.


I propose to adapt the HS FFI design, by forcing all translation functions to be defined in Agda.
This avoids making large changes to the Agda or Haskell language. The Agda-HS FFI itself will remain
restricted to plain types, dependent types live only inside the Agda world.

The translation function from the plain types to the dependent types could often be partial,
which will require it to either live in e.g. the Maybe monad or alternatively using Contracts as described in section \ref{sec:contracts}.

\subsection{Class System}
Recently, Agda has gained support for a sort-of class system using so-called instance arguments. This can
be used as seen in listing \ref{lst:agda-inst-ex}.
\begin{figure}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=12]{code/ClassAgda.agda}
\caption{Example Agda code using instance arguments.}
\label{lst:agda-inst-ex}
\end{figure}

In contrast to Haskell, there are no explicit class definitions. In the example above,
the record \texttt{Eq} doesn't differ from any normal record definition.
Haskell's Class Constraints, on the other hand, are similiar to the instance
arguments used in the definition of \texttt{test2} above.

As long as no cross-language class support is intended, the two class systems can be
regarded as completely seperate. If the ambition is to allow interaction across
language borders, matters get more complicated.

\paragraph{Translating Class Definitions}
First, we will define how to map Agda class definitions to Haskell. We assume
that class definitions are specially marked in Agda (e.g. pragma or keyword).

For each such class definition, we translate the record fields to functions
in the Haskell class. Fields of the record, which have a class type, are
translated into a class constraint. This proposal does not give any way
to specify default values like in haskell. An example of the translation
can be seen in \ref{lst:cls-agda-hs}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
record Eq (A : Set) : Set where
  field
    eq : A -> A -> Bool

record Ord (A : Set) : Set where
  field
    eqInst : Eq A
    lteq : A -> A -> Bool
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\hspace{10pt}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Eq a where
  eq :: a -> a -> Bool

class (Eq a) => Ord a where
  lteq :: a -> a -> Bool
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Translating Agda classes to Haskell.}
\label{lst:cls-agda-hs}
\end{figure}


Second, we also want to translate Haskell Class into Agda Classes. We only
consider classes without functional dependencies for this. An open question is
how Haskell default values should be encoded. The simplest approach would be
to just ignore the default values and treat them like normal class members.

An alternative would be to encode them explicitly in the Agda datatype, thereby
allowing Agda instances to make use of them. There are many possibilities in
how to encode this in the Agda datatype, one can be seen in listing \ref{lst:cls-hs-agda}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Eq a where
  eq :: a -> a -> Bool

class (Eq a) => Ord a where
  lteq :: a -> a -> Bool
  lt   :: a -> a -> Bool
  lt x y = (lteq x y) && not (x eq y)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\hspace{10pt}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
data HasDefault (A : Set) : Set where
  useImpl : A -> HasDefault A
  useDefault : HasDefault A

record Ord (A : Set) : Set where
  field
    eqInst : Eq A
    lteq : A -> A -> Bool
    lt' : HasDefault (A -> A -> Bool)

lt : {A : Set} {{e : Ord A}}
        -> A -> A -> Bool
lt {{o}} with Ord.lt' o
lt | useImpl x  = x
lt | useDefault = magicLtDefault
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Translating Haskell classes to Agda.}
\label{lst:cls-hs-agda}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Translating Haskell instances to Agda}
Translating classes alone is not worth much, we also need to make the
instances available. For this, we define how the instances get translated.
The actual implementation of the instances will call the haskell code
behind the scenes, for example using postulates or primitives. It is worth mentioning
that this will also influence type checking in the agda world, as it will not be
possible to reason about the instance definitions in the Agda world. This might makes some
of the Haskell type classes less useful inside Agda, but this doesn't apply to all of them.
An example of the translation can be seen in \ref{lst:inst-hs-agda}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
instance Eq Bool where
  eq x y = ....

instance Ord Bool where
  lteq = ....
  -- use default version of lt
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\hspace{10pt}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
instance
  eqBool : Eq Bool
  eqBool = record
        { eq = magicCallHaskell }

instance
  ordBool : Ord Bool
  ordBool = record
        { eqInst = eqBool
        ; lteq = magicCallHaskell
        ; lt = useDefault }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Translating Haskell instances to Agda.}
\label{lst:inst-hs-agda}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Translating Agda instances to Haskell}
The translation from Agda to Haskell is very similar and can be seen in listing \ref{lst:inst-agda-hs}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
instance
  eqBool : Eq Bool
  eqBool = record { eq = ... }

instance
  ordBool : Ord Bool
  ordBool = record
        { eqInst = eqBool
        ; lteq = ...
        ; lt = useDefault }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\hspace{10pt}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
instance Eq Bool where
  eq x y = magicCallAgda

instance Ord Bool where
  lteq = magicCallAgda
  -- use default version of lt
\end{lstlisting}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Translating Agda instances to Haskell.}
\label{lst:inst-agda-hs}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Feasability}
For the most simple classes like \texttt{Eq}, implementing it is expected to be
possible without any major changes in UHC. UHC uses dictionary-passing in it's Core representation,
and it should be possible to perform this mapping for Agda Code too.

For the more complicated cases with defaults and/or nested classes, this might pose more of a challenge.

\subsection{Parameterised Modules}
\label{sec:ffi:par-mod}
The Haskell Module system does have no concept of parameterised modules, therefore another representation is required. In the end,
all functions will have to get passed the module parameters explicitly. This could be done either by just prepending the module
argument list to all function definitions, or by wrapping the module parameters in a datatype and passing that around.

\subsection{Type-Checking interfacing}

%TODO rewrite with "foreign" HS approach

While a lot has been said about how to translate from Agda to Haskell and vice versa,
the question about when and by whom this translation is done has been left open. Clearly,
the UHC Haskell Compiler will need to know at least the Haskell-version of the Agda
function/datatype signatures. The same goes for the Agda type checker, which needs to
know the Agda representation of the used Haskell entitites.

As porting both UHC and Agda to a shared representation of Agda and Haskell code
is infeasible, the necessary information needs to be communicated in some other way.


Another option would be to teach UHC the Agda language or the other way round. This approach
is highly likely to require major changes in either Agda or UHC.
A less intrusive solution could involve creating a preprocesser, which emits the
information necessary for Agda/UHC to compile a program without actually parsing
the other language. 

This preprocessor might even be embedded into the compiler, for example Agda might create
a \texttt{.hi} file which UHC would use for type checking.

The preprocessor approach should be feasible for exposing Haskell definitions to Agda
without major problems, as the necessary support inside the Agda compiler has already
been tested in the prototype.
For the reverse direction, more questions remain open as UHC is currently not able
to import Core modules. Depending on how/if a Core import mechanism is added to UHC,
the answer to this question differs.


\subsection{Mixed Compilation}
Mixing Agda and Haskell files inside one package poses additional challenges. This is likely to require
major modifications in the Agda and UHC import chasing algorithms.

Restricting each package to only contain code from one language is expected to make the implementation
significantly easier. If mixed compilation is deemed worth the effort, it could still be implemented
at a later time.

\section{UHC Core Specification}
There is no complete specification of the UHC Core interface as of writing, as it was not
intended to be used as public API. The interface should be documented.

\section{Optimizations}
Due to the high-level nature of Agda, it is vital to optimize the generated
executables to achieve a good performance.

\subsection{Type Erasure}
Values of type \texttt{Set} cannot influence the result of any computations in Agda. They could be replaced
by a single unit type, without changing the value of the program.

Completely erasing the type parameters, in constrast, could change how expressions are evaluated.
As an expression wrapped in a type abstraction might become a naked top level
expression, more evaluation than necessary might take place.
\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
-- types not erased
f = \(x : Set) -> MyVal
case f of
 ... 

-- types erased
f' = MyVal
case f' of
 ...
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Pseudo-code illustrating the effects of type erasure.}
\label{lst:pseu-ty-eras}
\end{figure}

Listing \ref{lst:pseu-ty-eras} shows a pseudo-code illustration of the problem.
In the non-type-erased version, the evaluation of \texttt{MyVal} is blocked by the lambda abstraction in \texttt{f}.
In contrast, in the type-erased version \texttt{MyVal} is evaluated, as the lambda in \texttt{f} has been erased.

As Agda doesn't specify the
evaluation strategy, this shouldn't violate the semantics of Agda. It is also not clear if
it is possible in the first place to write such code in Agda, as inspecting a lambda abstraction
does not make much sense.

There is no clear answer (yet?) which approach is best. %, as it is a tradeoff between performance and simpler semantics.

\subsection{Other optimizations}
There are many other applicaple optimizations. I will restrict myself to documenting if/how they apply to this proposal,
but not provide any detailed descriptions. Please see \cite{fredriksson2011totaly} and \cite{Brady-store-indices2004}
for further details.

For most optimizations, the problems arise when traversing the HS-Agda boundary. The worker-wrapper
approach can migitate this problems, while imposing a slight performance penalty due to the
datatype translation necessary at the language border.
\paragraph{Forcing}
Changes datatype signature, hence requires special attention for the FFI.
A worker-wrapper approach is expected to be feasible.
% TODO what can be used from the TypeChecker forcing infrastructure?

\paragraph{Erasure}
A generalized version of type erasure, removing all unused arguments and/or datatype fields.
Changes function and/or datatype signatures, hence requires special attention for the FFI.
A worker-wrapper approach is expected to be feasible.
% UHC may already implements some sort of erasure, but this has not yet been researched in detail.

\paragraph{Injection Detection}
Depends on constructor tag assignment order. Not clear if this can work well if Agda modules can be compiled
seperatly. Might also interfere with the tag-invariants expected by UHC.
For module-scoped Agda-only datatypes, this opimization should be possible without
problems.

\paragraph{Smashing}
I expect no problems, as this optimization only changes the computation inside a function, but not
its signature or semantics.

\paragraph{Primitive Data (Nat-like)}
Changes function and/or datatype signatures, hence requires special attention for the FFI.
A worker-wrapper approach is expected to be feasible. In addition, some special
HS or Agda function to convert a primitive datatype to the HS-integer datatype and vice-versa could be
implemented.

It might be also possible to implement a part of this optimization on the UHC Core level, which would solve all
FFI concers.

\section{Contracts (for FFI)}
\label{sec:contracts}
The FFI interface proposed in \ref{sec:prop:hs-ffi} limits the cross-language interaction
to "plain" datatypes. As described before, lifting such "plain" datatypes to more expressive
Agda values might be partial. Similarly, the HS type system might not be strong enough
to encode invariants that are known to hold, eg $Even(x) \land Even(y) \Rightarrow Even(x + y)$.

It would be favourable to have a way to specify the post-/precondition at the language-boundary
to avoid lifting all code into a partiality-monad such as Maybe.
We propose to use Contracts for this purpose. (Contracts could
theoretically also be applied to pure Agda Code, but this would defeat the purpose of Agda.)

The use of such contracts is especially beneficial to annotate Agda-to-HS calls with invariants
of the Haskell function. To be more precise, this would be the postcondition of the Haskell function.

To implement such a scheme, a decision function is required. If the postcondition is not met,
the function call will fail at runtime. A short example of the desired functionality can be seen in listing \ref{lst:agda-con-ex}
for the case of calling HS from Agda.


\begin{figure}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=28,lastline=85]{code/ContractsAgda.agda}
\caption{How Contracts in Agda could look like.}
\label{lst:agda-con-ex}
\end{figure}

It is less clear if Contracts should also be available/used for HS-to-Agda calls.

Another open question is how
contracts can be expressed syntactically in a concise manner, while not obscuring the dangers of using contracts.
Furthermore, it might be not always obvious which invariants for a FFI Call are worth asserting. It could be beneficial
to allow the contracts to be seperated from the FFI declaration itself, as to allow the addition of further invariants later on.


\section{Cabal Integration}
As the proposed Agda Compiler is built upon UHC and with a HS FFI in mind, it would be desirable
to leverage the features of Cabal for Agda programs. This would encompass being able
to install Agda packages using Cabal as well as allowing dependencies between Agda and HS packages.
This feature would likely need some changes in Agda, especially
for the interactive mode.

\section{UHC Changes}
For the proposal laid out so far, certain changes in UHC itself appear
unavoidable. A preliminary list of this changes is as follows:

%\subsection{Index Datatypes by Aspects - WIP}
%TODO just an idea...
%Binds inside expressions can be indexed by aspects, which does
%not apply to data types. However, there may be multiple definitions
%of the same data type caused by worker/wrapper style transformations/optimizations.
%While this definitions could be encoded using a naming convention, a more explicit
%approach may be preferrable.

\subsection{Module support for Core}
At the moment, UHC can only compile exactly one core file to an executable.
While this core file may import modules from other packages, it is not possible
to import other Core files or build a package from multiple Core files.

\subsection{UHC Library on hackage}
UHC uses a traditional "./configure \&\& make" build process. If the parts used by the
Agda backend could be split of into a normal cabal package residing on hackage,
making this library a hard dependency of Agda might be possible.
It would also allow the cabal dependency solver to figure out a compatible
set of packages for both UHC and Agda, which may goes wrong in the current setup.
It would also simplify the installation of UHC/Agda and make it easier to use the cabal sandbox feature for development.

\subsection{Cabal support for UHC}
The cabal support for installing packages into the UHC database is broken. If this would work, it
would marginally simplify the installation of the uhc-agda-base package.
