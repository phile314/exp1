UHC General Notes
===================

W   "make install" broken when configured with "--enable-core-asinpoutp".
W   UHC cannot be installed via cabal/hackage.
      * uhc does not participate in the cabal dependency solving when installing
        agda, so it needs some manual guidance when installing the UHC library to
        avoid incompatible dependencies.
      * how to pass cabal arguments to UHC make install?
      * Cannot be a hard, unconditional dependency of Agda

UHC Core Notes
================

W   parse(print(x)) /= x  (HsName's (_Base vs _Modf), CBinds for apps using non-keyed/keyed)
W   UHC requires import names to be of type HsName_Modf, else package lookup fails.
    Should either be documented and maybe produce a warning if the wrong type of name
    is given, or be fixed.
R   UHC Core "Case" seems to depend on the order of alternatives, instead of using the CTags.
    Changing the order of alternatives without changing their body seems to alter the semantics.
    In UHC generated Core, alternatives are ordered by tag/alphabetical by constructor name.
    (Workaround: sort branches by tag/constructor before emitting core)
R   Tags in Core expressions are fixed after parsing, so only tags in the datatype
    metadata seem to matter (NOT yet verified, not used by Agda Core backend)
R   When building a package (--pkg-build), ehc will not create the proper package files
    when the library contains a main function
R   Function names have to start with a lower case letter.
R   cabal install --uhc is broken, possibly due to different base versions
    (UHC has 3.0, cabal 1.16 expects 4)
W   HS generated datatypes should prefix constructors with the datatype name
