UHC Wishlist
============

- UHC Core "Case" seems to depend on the order of alternatives, instead of using the CTags.
  Changing the order of alternatives without changing their body seems to alter the semantics.
  In UHC generated Core, alternatives are ordered by tag/alphabetical by constructor name.
  (Workaround: sort branches by tag/constructor before emitting core)

======
PENDING
======

-Use EHC Core import support for linking Prelude primitives with Agda Core
-Test and fix support for Agda Datatypes (ignoring any HS-FFI concerns)
-Support for compiling multiple Agda modules
-Finish support for binary core

====
DONE
====

-Fix wrong tags for data constructors in generated Core
-Add builtin Unit to Agda, map to Haskell () / Core Tag Rec
-Add builtin Nat to Agda, map to Nat-datatype defined in UHC.Agda.Builtins
-Start writing proper generic prelude (UHC.Agda.Builtins, [1])
-Call UHC from Agda
