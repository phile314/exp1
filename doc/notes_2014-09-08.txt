Simple example works with manual linking (HelloWorld)
Prelude-linking - work in progress
  Core parser/pretty printer issue

Plan:
1W  Fix prelude linking, HelloWorld working with linking
2-3W  Make bigger self-contained example work


Module support for Core?
Compile std lib?


Problem areas:
  Bidirectional import/export?
  how to represent dependently typed functions in Haskell? just ignore them or somehow represent them there as well?
  Class System?
  Seperate Compiliation -> Update HI files, requires rework some parts of UHC
                           Exporting identifiers, types, names etc...
                           FFI how to import/export
                           Optimizations might interfere with interfacing

Atze:
  Aims for big core file/linking to HS files
  

Deliverables:
  Documentation of future work packages
